    <div class="about">
        <p><b>OSTTEOC</b> is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing quality education to children from underprivileged backgrounds. Founded in [1998 A.D], our mission is to break the cycle of poverty through education and empower children to build a better future for themselves and their communities.
            We believe that every child deserves access to a quality education, regardless of their socio-economic background. Through our various programs and initiatives, we strive to provide children with the tools, resources, and support they need to succeed in school and beyond.
            Our team of dedicated educators, volunteers, and supporters work tirelessly to make a positive impact in the lives of these children. Together, we are creating a brighter, more hopeful future for generations to come.
            Join us in our mission to make quality education accessible to all. Together, we can make a difference, one child at a time.</p>
